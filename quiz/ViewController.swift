    // store them in the global variables q and a. It will check to see
    // if the text fields are blank to only allow a question and answer
    // if information is in the text fields. If both new values
    // contain strings then they will be added to the global
    // questions and answers arrays. It will also clear the text fields
    // to allow more input of new questions and answers.

    // contain valid entries.
    // Post: Adds the new question and answer to their propper arrays to then
    // be sown within the quiz tab.
